# Objectiv Backend

Running the backend will enable you to receive and process tracking data in your environment. It consists of three images:

* `objectiv_collector` - Endpoint that the Objectiv-tracker can send events to (http://localhost:5000).
* `objectiv_postgres` - Database to store data.
* `objectiv_notebook` - Jupyter notebook that can be used to query the data (http://localhost:8888).

## Running the Backend Dockerized
The below commands assume that you have `docker-compose` [installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
```bash
docker-compose pull  # pull pre-built images from gcr
docker-compose up    # spin up Objective pipeline
```
SECURITY WARNING: The above docker-compose commands start a postgres container that allows connections
without verifying passwords. Do not use this in production or on a shared system!

For detailed installation & usage instructions, visit [Objectiv Docs](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/tracking/collector).
