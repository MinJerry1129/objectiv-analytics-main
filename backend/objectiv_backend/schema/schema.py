        A MediaEvent that's emitted after a media item stops playback.

        Attributes:
        location_stack (List[AbstractLocationContext]):
                The location stack is an ordered list (stack), that contains a hierarchy of location contexts that
                deterministically describes where an event took place from global to specific.
                The whole stack (list) is needed to exactly pinpoint where in the UI the event originated.
        global_contexts (List[AbstractGlobalContext]):
                Global contexts add global / general information about the event. They carry information that is not
                related to where the Event originated (location), such as device, platform or business data.
        id (str):
                Unique identifier for a specific instance of an event. Typically UUID's are a good way of
                implementing this. On the collector side, events should be unique, this means duplicate id's result
                in `not ok` events.
        time (int):
                Timestamp indicating when the event was generated.
