Aggregation
===========

Aggregation models perform multiple Bach instructions that run some of the more common data analyses or
product analytics metrics. Always return aggregated data in some form from the
:class:`DataFrame <bach.DataFrame>` the model is applied to. Aggregation models can be accessed with the
:attr:`aggregate <modelhub.ModelHub.aggregate>` accessor from a model hub instance.
