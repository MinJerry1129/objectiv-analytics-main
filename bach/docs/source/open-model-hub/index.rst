Open model hub
==============
The open model hub is a toolkit with functions and models that can run directly on a full dataset collected 
with Objectiv's Tracker SDKs. All models are open-source, free to use, and can easily be combined to build 
advanced compound models.

How to use the open model hub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following types of functions/models are provided: 
1. :doc:`Helper functions <./models/helper-functions/index>`: Simplify manipulating and analyzing the data.
2. :doc:`Aggregation models <./models/aggregation/index>`: Enable running some of the more common data 
analyses and product analytics metrics.
3. :doc:`Machine learning models <./models/machine-learning/index>`: ML models such as logistic regression.
4. :doc:`Funnels <./models/funnels/index>`: To analyze Funnels, e.g. discover all the (top) user journeys 
that lead to conversion or drop-off.

Modeling behavior of users and groups is enabled through configurable 
:doc:`Identity Resolution <./identity-resolution>`.

See how to :doc:`get started in your notebook <../get-started-in-your-notebook>` and the 
:doc:`example notebooks <../example-notebooks/index>`, and install the model hub package directly from PyPI:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install objectiv-modelhub


Powered by Bach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The open model hub is powered by :ref:`Bach <bach>`: Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can 
compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations that use an SQL abstraction layer to run on the 
full dataset. Models can be output to SQL with one command.
