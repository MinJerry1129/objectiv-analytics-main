Modeling with Objectiv
======================

Objectiv's modeling toolkit enables you to quickly build advanced data models and run in-depth analyses. 
This is the combined result of three components:

1. The open analytics taxonomy.
1. The open model hub.
1. The Bach modeling library.

### The open analytics taxonomy

Objectiv's tracker validates all collected data against the open analytics taxonomy to ensure it is ready to 
model on without any cleaning or transformation. 

`Learn more about the open analytics taxonomy </docs/taxonomy/>`_

### The open model hub

The open model hub is a toolkit that contains functions and models that can be applied on data collected with 
Objectivâ€™s Tracker. They can be combined to build advanced compound models with little effort. The open model 
hub is powered by Bach, our python-based modeling library.

### The Bach modeling library

Bach is a python-based modeling library that enables you to use Pandas-like operations that run on your full 
dataset in the SQL database. Any dataframe or model built with Bach can be converted to an SQL statement with 
a single command.
