Open model hub basics
=====================

In this example, we briefly demonstrate how you can use pre-built models from the open model hub in
conjunction with, :ref:`Bach <bach>`, our modeling library. It's also available in a `notebook
<https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/model-hub-demo-notebook.ipynb>`_
to run on your own data or use our `quickstart <https://objectiv.io/docs/home/try-the-demo/>`_ to try it 
out with demo data in 5 minutes.

This example uses real, unaltered data that was collected from https://objectiv.io with Objectiv’s Tracker. All models
in the open model hub are compatible with data sets that have been validated against the
`open analytics taxonomy
<https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/>`_.

First we have to install the open model hub and instantiate the Objectiv DataFrame object; see
:doc:`getting started in your notebook <../get-started-in-your-notebook>`.

Using the open model hub
------------------------
The open model hub is a growing collection of open-source, free to use data models that you can take,
combine and run for product analysis and exploration. It includes models for a wide range of typical product
analytics use cases. The source is available for all models and you're free to make any changes to them.

The model hub has the following types of functions/models:
1. :doc:`Helper functions <../open-model-hub/models/helper-functions/index>`: Simplify manipulating and 
analyzing the data.
2. :doc:`Aggregation models <../open-model-hub/models/aggregation/index>`: Enable running some of the more 
common data analyses and product analytics metrics.
3. :doc:`Machine learning models <../open-model-hub/models/machine-learning/index>`: ML models such as 
logistic regression.
4. :doc:`Funnels <../open-model-hub/models/funnels/index>`: To analyze Funnels, e.g. discover all the (top) 
user journeys that lead to conversion or drop-off.

Helper functions always return a series with the same shape and index as the
:class:`DataFrame <bach.DataFrame>` they are applied to. This ensures they can be added as a column to that
DataFrame. Helper functions that return :class:`SeriesBoolean <bach.SeriesBoolean>` can be used to filter
the data. The helper functions can be accessed with the :attr:`map <modelhub.ModelHub.map>` accessor from a
model hub instance.

Aggregation models perform multiple Bach instructions that run some of the more common data analyses or
product analytics metrics. Always return aggregated data in some form from the
:class:`DataFrame <bach.DataFrame>` the model is applied to. Aggregation models can be accessed with the
:attr:`aggregate <modelhub.ModelHub.aggregate>` accessor from a model hub instance.

Most of the model hub helper functions and aggregation models take `data` as their first argument: this is
the DataFrame with the Objectiv data to apply the model to. For an example of a machine learning model look
at the :doc:`logistic regression example <logistic-regression>`.

The next examples demonstrate how to use the model hub by showcasing a selection of the models from the model hub.

A simple aggregation model
--------------------------
Calculating the unique users is one of the basic models in the model hub. As it is an aggregation model, it is called with `model_hub.aggregate.unique_users()`. It uses the *time_aggregation* that is set when the model hub was instantiated. With `.head()` we immediately query the data to show the results. `.to_pandas()` can be used to use all results as a pandas object in python.

.. code-block:: python

    modelhub.aggregate.unique_users(df)

Using `map` with the model hub & combining models
-------------------------------------------------
This example shows how you use map to label users as a new user. This uses *time_aggregation*. As *time_aggregation* was set to '%Y-%m-%d' it means all hits are labeled as new for the entire day in which the user had its first session.

.. code-block:: python

    df['is_new_user'] = modelhub.map.is_new_user(df)

Or we can label conversion events. To do this we first have to define what a conversion is by setting the
type of event and the location on the product at which this event was triggered with `add_conversion_event`
(this is called the location stack, see :ref:`location_stack` for info).

.. code-block:: python

    modelhub.add_conversion_event(location_stack=df.location_stack.json[{'id': 'Quickstart Guide', '_type': 'LinkContext'}:],
                                  event_type='PressEvent',
                                  name='quickstart_presses')
    df['conversion_events'] = modelhub.map.is_conversion_event(df, 'quickstart_presses')

Map, filter, aggregate
----------------------
As the map functions above retured a SeriesBoolean, they can be used in the model hub combined with a filter and aggregation models. We use the same aggregation model we showed earlier (`unique_users`), but now with the filter `df.conversion_events` applied. This gives the unique converted users per day.

.. code-block:: python

    modelhub.aggregate.unique_users(df[df.conversion_events]).sort_index(ascending=False).head(10)

Similarly, we can use other aggregation models from the model hub. In the example below, the average session duration is calculated for new users.

.. code-block:: python

    modelhub.aggregate.session_duration(df[df.is_new_user])

Combining model results
-----------------------
Results from aggregation models can be used together if they share the same index type (similar to pandas). In this example the share of new users per day is calculated.

.. code-block:: python

    modelhub.agg.unique_users(df[df.is_new_user]) / modelhub.agg.unique_users(df)

Using multiple model hub filters
--------------------------------
The model hub's map results can be combined and reused. In this example we set two helper function's results
as a column to the original DataFrame and use them both to filter the data and apply an aggregation model.
In this example we calculate the number of users that were new in a month and also that converted twice on a day.

.. code-block:: python

    df['is_new_user_month'] = modelhub.map.is_new_user(df, time_aggregation = '%Y-%m')
    df['is_twice_converted'] = modelhub.map.conversions_in_time(df, name='quickstart_presses')==2
    modelhub.aggregate.unique_users(df[df.is_new_user_month & df.is_twice_converted]).sort_index(ascending=False).head()

What's next?
------------
There are several options on how to continue working with the data or using the results otherwise, i.e. for visualization.

1. Export models to SQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As mentioned, all operations and models performed on the DataFrame are run on the SQL data base. Therefore it is possible to view all objects as an SQL statement. For the `new_user_share` results that was created this looks as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    display_sql_as_markdown(new_user_share)


2. Further data crunching using the Bach Modeling Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All results from the model hub are in the form of Bach DataFrames or Series. This makes the model hub and Bach work seamlessly together.

.. code-block:: python

    # We'll do a lot of operations on the data in the df DataFrame. To make this easier for the
    # database (especially BigQuery), we tell Bach to materialize the current DataFrame as temporary
    # table. This statement has no direct effect, but any invocation of head() on the dataframe later
    # on will consist of two queries: one to create a temporary table with the current state of the
    # dataframe, and one that queries that table and does subsequent operations
    df = df.materialize(materialization='temp_table')

.. code-block:: python

    # label the number of time a user is converted in a session at a moment using the model hub.
    df['conversion_count'] = modelhub.map.conversions_in_time(df, name='quickstart_presses')

    # use Bach to do any supported operation using pandas syntax.
    # select users that converted
    converted_users = df[df.conversion_events].user_id.unique()
    # select PressEvents of users that converted
    df_selection = df[(df.event_type == 'PressEvent') &
                      (df.user_id.isin(converted_users))]
    # calculate the number of PressEvents before conversion per session
    presses_per_session = df_selection[df_selection.conversion_count == 0].groupby('session_id').session_hit_number.count()

Show the results, now the underlying query is executed.

.. code-block:: python

    presses_per_session.head()

There is another :ref:`example <bach_examples>` that demonstrates what you can do with the Bach modeling
library, or head over to the :ref:`Bach API reference <bach_api_reference>` for a complete overview of the possibilities.

3. Export DataFrame and model hub results to pandas DataFrame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bach DataFrames and/or model hub results can always be exported to pandas. Since Bach DataFrame operation run on the full dataset in the SQL database, it is recommended to export to pandas if data small enough; ie by aggregation or selection.
By exporting the data to pandas you can use all the options from pandas as well as pandas compatible ML packages.

We plot the previously calculated presses per session before conversion using pandas built-in plotting methods.

.. code-block:: python

    # presses_per_session_pd is a pandas Series
    presses_per_session_pd = presses_per_session.to_pandas()
    presses_per_session_pd.hist()

This concludes the open model hub demo.

We hope you’ve gotten a taste of the power and flexibility of the open model hub to quickly answer common product analytics questions. You can take it a lot further and build highly specific model stacks for in-depth analysis and exploration.
