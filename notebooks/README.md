# Example Notebooks
This directory contains several example notebooks on how you can analyze and model data using the [open model hub](https://objectiv.io/docs/modeling/open-model-hub/). These notebooks can be used as a starting point for your own analyses as well.

## Set up development environment
Please see the model hub [README.md](../modelhub/README.md) to set up your environment. After that, execute 
the commands below in the same `venv` as where you did the model hub install. 

Now it should be as simple as:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt # install notebook specific requirements
jupyter-notebook [any notebook from this directory]
```

## Notebooks 
Please see the most complete list of examples at [the model hub example page on Objectiv.io](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/example-notebooks/) 
or have a look at the files in this directory; most of them have a pretty decent introduction.
