# The Open Analytics Taxonomy

The open analytics taxonomy is a generic classifification of common event types and the contexts in which they can happen. It is a proposal for a common way to collect & structure analytics data in an effort to enable models to be universally shared and reused between projects, teams and companies.

Visit [Objectiv Docs](https://objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/) to learn more.

## Purpose

Objectiv uses the Open Taxonomy to:
* Enable realtime validation of instrumentation and provide debugging feedback.
* Structure and validate data collection at the first step of the pipeline.
* Enable effective feature creation when building models.
* Enable models and data sets to be reused with minimal effort.

The open analytics taxonomy is captured in a schema that is loosely based on JSON-schema and uses JSON5 encoding to allow for multiline strings. 

## Using the Open Taxonomy
Objectiv is built around the Open Taxonomy and the Tracker, Collector and Bach use it out of the box.

For detailed installation & usage instructions of Objectiv, visit [Objectiv Docs](https://www.objectiv.io/docs).
